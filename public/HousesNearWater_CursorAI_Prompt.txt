Overview:
You are building the frontend and content structure for HousesNearWater.com, a real estate discovery platform focused exclusively on homes located near water in the United States. The website must be intuitive, SEO-friendly, and scalable.

Goal:
Help users quickly browse and discover houses near lakes, oceans, rivers, and waterfronts across the U.S., filtered by state, city, body of water, and proximity to popular locations.

Homepage Requirements:
Design a homepage with clear navigation to the following primary sections:

1. Browse by State
- List all 50 states
- Each state page should link to:
  - Cities with waterfront homes
  - Lakes, rivers, and coastal areas in that state

2. Browse by City
- Major cities with notable waterfront properties (e.g., Miami, Seattle, Chicago)
- City pages should link to specific neighborhoods or nearby bodies of water

3. Browse by Water Type
- Oceanfront Homes
- Lakefront Homes
- Riverfront Homes
- Canal/Waterway Homes
- Bayfront Properties

Each type should be a standalone SEO page with links to states/cities where those properties exist.

4. Featured Bodies of Water
Create landing pages for popular lakes, rivers, and coastlines:
- Lake Tahoe, Lake Michigan, Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico, etc.
- Each water body page should show:
  - Nearby cities/towns
  - Active real estate listings
  - Info about the body of water

- "Lakefront homes for sale in [City], [State]"
